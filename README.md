# react-flag-game

The app is built using Create React App. Currently the app is a non-funtioning static version rendering images of European flags. The intent is to develop an interactive game.

### Future development:
The interactive version of the app will involve these features. First of all, managing component states and respond to user events. Each image will listen for click events, and the app will keep track of the user's score. The score will increment when an image is clicked for the first time. If an image is clicked a second time, the score will be reset to 0. Every time an image is clicked, the rendered images will shuffle themselves in a random order. If an image is clicked a second time, the score will reset and the game will restart.
